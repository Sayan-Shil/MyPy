#Let us learn how to input any value and print in terminal as Output 



# Use  input() for Input

a = input("Enter Something.......")                      # syntax-   type(input(<Message>))     
b= (int)(input("What is your number ?"))                 # by default (type) == String            ** input do not add newline
 
# Use  print() for Output 
print(a)                                                 # By Default - String Type
print(b)                                                 # Int Type

print("I am Good Boy" +a)                                # Using "+" before variable name , we can add variable to print
 
 
#  Python is  "space sensitive," which means that the amount of indentation (spaces or tabs) used to define code blocks is significant. As Python
#  do not allow "()" , "{}" , ";" for defining blocks , it uses indentation for defining code blocks

 
"""
print("Hello")           --> OK
 print("Hello")          --> Not Ok , why extra space?
